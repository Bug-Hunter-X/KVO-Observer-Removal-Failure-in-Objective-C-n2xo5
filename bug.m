In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error arises when dealing with KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management.  If an observer is not properly removed when it's no longer needed (e.g., before the observed object is deallocated or when the observer itself is deallocated), it can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. This is particularly insidious because the crash might not occur immediately; instead, it might happen much later when the observed object is released while the observer still holds a dangling pointer.

For instance:

```objectivec
@interface MyObserver : NSObject
@end

@implementation MyObserver
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // ... observation logic ...
}
@end

@interface MyObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *someProperty;
@end

@implementation MyObject
- (instancetype)init {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        MyObserver *observer = [[MyObserver alloc] init];
        [self addObserver:observer forKeyPath:@
