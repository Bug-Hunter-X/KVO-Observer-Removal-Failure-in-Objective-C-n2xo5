# Objective-C KVO Memory Management Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and memory management. The bug stems from failing to remove KVO observers when they are no longer needed, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

The primary issue lies in the improper management of KVO observers.  When an observer is added to an object using `addObserver:forKeyPath:options:context:`, it's crucial to remove that observer using `removeObserver:forKeyPath:` when the observation is no longer required. Failing to do so can result in dangling pointers and unexpected behavior, particularly when the observed object is deallocated while the observer still holds a reference.

## How to Reproduce

The `bug.m` file contains code that demonstrates the bug. Run the code to observe the crash or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version of the code. It demonstrates the proper method for removing KVO observers using `removeObserver:forKeyPath:` in appropriate scenarios (e.g., before the observer or observed object is deallocated).
